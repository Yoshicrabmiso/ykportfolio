                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>During the COVID pandemic, ANA, a Japanese airline, aimed to offer customers a virtual travel
                  experience.
                  To fulfill this goal, We developed "ANAGranwhale," a metaverse platform allowing players to explore
                  Japanese
                  landmarks in virtual reality. This not only addresses the issue of ANA frequent flyers being unable to
                  utilize their travel miles during real time traveling, but also serves as a platform for discovering
                  places
                  to visit in Japan post-pandemic. </p>

                <h4>My Role</h4>
                <p>Over the course of <strong>6 months</strong>, I was tasked with improving the user experience of the
                  metaverse platform following its initial launch. I leveraged data-driven research to inform my designs
                  and adapted to both internal and external environments by mastering design tools like <strong>Adobe
                    XD</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. </p>

                    <div class="portfolio_row_text">
                      <h4>How I got started </h4>
                      <p>At Scopenext, I was chosen to represent the company’s <strong>lead designer </strong>for this
                        project, leveraging our strong data management services while expanding into gaming design
                        field. Joining the design team after the initial launch, the stakeholders requested that I, as
                        an external designer with no prior involvement, evaluate the project's UX. So drawing on my
                        background in research and design, my first step was to gather as much player feedbacks as
                        possible.</p>
                      <h4>It is all about the experience </h4>
                      <p>When I initially looked at some of the reviews written about ANA Granwhale, the majority of
                        them said “good concept, bad usability”, “get bored easily” . The data reflected this, showing
                        that <strong>73%</strong> of users logged out within <strong>15 minutes</strong> , and
                        <strong>68%</strong> left empty handed. This <strong>68%</strong> was a critical metric for ANA,
                        as the app was designed to encourage users to spend travel miles and engage in virtual shopping.
                        However, I strongly believe the key to any successful metaverse platform is sustained user
                        engagement, as the time players spend directly influences their willingness to invest in the
                        platform.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="portfolio_row_text">
                      <h4>Community Feature</h4>
                      <p>I proposed adding a community feature with <strong>private </strong>and <strong>open
                          chats</strong> centered around the concept of 'touring together.' Previously, users could send
                        brief messages for instant communication with those nearby. Now, the focus has shifted to live
                        chats that allow interaction with everyone across different areas.I also contributed the design
                        of avatar action as well as emojis to color the chat experience.</p>
                      <h4>Getting buy-in and Compromise</h4>
                      <p>Collaborating with external teams on a large project like this was challenging, especially
                        since I wasn't the only designer involved. Securing buy-in from the primary design team at JP
                        Games tested my ability to manage UI design tasks. Updating the design system was particularly
                        difficult due to my skillset. While my go to tools are <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Adobe
                          XD</strong>, JP Games, being a gaming company, relied on <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and
                        <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. This required me to compromise my skillset and learn new tools
                        to bridge the gap between designers and game developers.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="portfolio_row_text">
                      <h4>UI Concept</h4>
                      <p>My task as a UI designer was updating the existing UI elements from Adobe Photoshop to Unreal
                        Engine while creating new ones on Figma. <br>
                        The app's theme, 'Sky Travel,' inspired the use of gradients in banners and buttons to create
                        smooth color transitions. Given that ANA GranWhale operates similarly to a gaming platform, we
                        designed 3D buttons, which are widely accepted in gaming UI. To maintain player attention to the
                        game, we made most of the cards, modals, and popups transparent—another common feature in gaming
                        industry. Due to <strong>non-disclosure agreement</strong>, I cannot share the UI components
                        created in Unreal Engine, but this image was exported from Figma.</p>


                      <h4>After Implementing...</h4>
                      <p>The implementation of the community feature introduced a new way to engage with ANA GranWhale.
                        Since the chat room could be accessed anytime, anywhere in the game, players began clustering in
                        the lobby (the first location upon login), which led to lagging issues and frequent app
                        restarts. While the <strong>shopping rate</strong> initially increased by <strong>12%</strong>
                        in the first month, it saw a <strong>7%</strong> decline in the second. However, an unexpected
                        trend emerged—more players began purchasing V-Trip, a virtual travel coupon that transports
                        avatars to specific locations. Interestingly, many players started using V-Trips together,
                        traveling to new locations with their chat buddies, spawning into V-Trip destinations at the
                        same time!</p>

                      <h4>Reflection</h4>
                      <p>I still view this outcome to be positive, because more than <strong>45%</strong>of players
                        stayed longer than 15 minutes. Additionally, more players are spending their travel miles on
                        V-Trips, effectively driving monetization. However, our stakeholders were hopping to capitalize
                        more on the virtual shopping experience given its potential for brand collaborations. With more
                        players active in the platform, it was time to focus on new issue - <strong>how to get people
                          excited to buy virtual items</strong>.</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>While developing ANAGranwhale, we encountered a problem of <strong>item possession</strong>. Previous
                  data showed the players did not want to spend their travel miles on just buying clothes and
                  accessories for their avatar since virtual item tend to lose its value once players stop using the
                  platform. As a solution, we created a separate e-commerce site called "ANAGranWhale NFTMarketplace"
                  where players could purchase virtual items as NFTs, and retain value for future investment.</p>

                <h4>My Role</h4>
                <p>Unlike the ANA GranWhale project, I worked primarily with internal design and development teams. From
                  researching current NFT markets and users purchase flows to building design systems and information
                  architecture for cryptocurrency transaction, I challenged myself to manage the whole project as much
                  as possible for <strong>1.5 years</strong>. I also made many tradeoffs along the way...</p>

                      <h4>From Metaverse to NFT</h4>
                      <p>After realizing that the growing number of active users didn’t directly affect shopping rates
                        in ANA GranWhale, our team asked the stakeholders to create a questionnaire focused on the
                        players' shopping experience. With the help of ANA's data, we discovered that a significant
                        number of players wanted to see more items in the store. While we knew the limited selection of
                        avatar wearables, given the app’s early stage, needed improvement, one piece of feedback stood
                        out the most:</p>
                      <div class="anonymous_review">
                        <i>I love traveling with my friends in the virtual world. I like the clothes in the shop but I
                          feel like there isn’t more I can buy.
                          I would love to see some unique products to customize my experience in V-trip.</i>
                      </div>
                      <p>The two words—"unique" and "customize"—made me think about <strong>what we can offer</strong>
                        rather than <strong>what we can deliver</strong>. Leveraging my company's strongest
                        asset—blockchain technology—I proposed introducing NFT items to ANA GranWhale. NFT items are
                        typically created by artists, which ties the idea of adding value to the shopping experience
                        through global networking.</p>
                      <h4>Lots of Paperwork</h4>
                      <p>It was easier said than done. It took us two months to get buy-in from stakeholders and another
                        four months to integrate blockchain technology into ANA GranWhale. We faced several technical
                        challenges, including data acquisition, data storage, data interoperability, and privacy
                        preservation. I collaborated closely with the product manager to write a business proposal,
                        highlighting the potential of digital product ownership trading for individual consumers. To
                        facilitate this trading, we proposed the creation of an NFT Marketplace for ANA GranWhale.</p>

                      <h4>Thanks, Adobe XD...</h4>
                      <p>Since it is a service created under ANAGranwhale, the NFT marketplace has many similar UIs to
                        begin with. We first replicated the original UI in Adobe XD, and started creating new elements
                        native to website such as input controls, navigation, and footers, etc. <br>
                        But as soon as we finished designing the first prototype, Adobe announced plans to <strong>phase
                          out Adobe XD</strong> by 2024. Fearing the future maintenance issues in the tool, we were
                        instructed to transfer all prototype files and assets from XD to Figma. This was the tedious,
                        manual work I have done in my UI career because I was the only designer who was familiar with
                        Figma! My method was simple, start by manually create text and color styles on Figma, then copy
                        design elements over from XD in SVG format. While converting to SVG was efficient for images,
                        icons, and patterns, it wasn’t suitable for other elements, which I had to recreate manually...

                        <h4>Payment methods</h4>
                        <p>The marketplace’s goal is to <strong>create a platform for consumers to buy NFTs</strong>.
                          However, adoption is relarively low in Japan, with only <strong>30.8%</strong> awareness and
                          <strong>3.2%</strong>ownership of NFTs.
                          <a href="https://www.watch.impress.co.jp/img/ipw/docs/1432/422/html/mmd_01_o.jpg.html"><u>(NFT認知率は3割、保有は3％
                              スポーツ・ アニメが人気 MMD調査)</u> </a>.
                          To address this, we introduced an additional payment option: <strong>users can pay with either
                            cryptocurrency or credit cards.</strong> This allows those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency
                          can purchase NFTs easily and securely, similar to regular online shopping. Additionally, since
                          many users took time in choosing payment methods as well as studying how to create wallet for
                          digital
                          currency, a <strong>15 minute</strong> payment time limit was added for both methods to
                          enhance security.
                        </p>

                    <div class="portfolio_row_text">
                      <h4>Search Filter</h4>
                      <p>After the initial launch, we gathered data through <strong>heat maps</strong> and
                        <strong>usability testing</strong>, revealing that the search filter was the most frequently
                        used feature, as users were extensively exploring different categories. The testing showed that
                        many users relied on the filters because the homepage displayed cryptocurrency prices, which
                        caused confusion. To address this, we updated the homepage to show prices in JPY by default. We
                        also expanded the FAQs to better explain cryptocurrency, wallets, gas fees, and NFTs, to
                        improved the user flow to make connecting to crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, easier.</p>
                      <h4>Reflection</h4>
                      <p>The NFT Marketplace opened new opportunities for customer experiences, generating additional
                        revenue through commissions and brand collaborations. One month after the website’s release, the
                        shopping rate from ANA GranWhale users increased by <strong>30%</strong>, and
                        <strong>15%</strong> of daily active users who weren’t part of ANA GranWhale also visited the
                        site to purchase items for their collections. However, as NFTs are still relatively new in
                        Japan, many early users complained about the website's usability and the lack of clear
                        instructions during the sign-up process. If I were to continue this project, I would implement
                        onboarding tutorials to guide users after signing up.</p>
