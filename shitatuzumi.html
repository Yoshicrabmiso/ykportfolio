        </h3>
        <p>LIke many countries, many Japanese turn to food delivery services to address meal preparation problems. We need to find a core user needs for catering that separates the ones in food delivery services and deliver the prototype within a short amount of time.</p>
        <h4> Our high level goals were to:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop MVP  within 2 months using a non-coding app development tool - Flutterflow</li>
          <li>Create a core value between users and chefs.</li>
          <li>Design and develop at the same time</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> My Role</h4>
        <p>In a team of three, I led secondary research, prototyping, and usability testing while also managing project execution from Figma design to Flutterflow (non-coding development software).

        <h3>Introduction: From a chef to a business owner</h3>
        <p>This project idea came from my client who happened to be a chef in Japan.
          While spending most of his time cooking in a Chinese restaurant, he explored a potential career development in the culinary industry - a service that connects chefs and users. He began by attending non-coding app development bootcamp while searching for business partners and collaborators who can consult and develop the app from 0 to 1.

                We have discussed whether or not we should make high fidelity prototype on Figma, and because

                However, Flutterflow’s base design language is Material Design 3, which gives limited customizations for
                designers. To tackle this issue, I implemented their built-in widgets into developing MVP, but planning
                to update with datepickers with better customizations that comes close to my original design.
