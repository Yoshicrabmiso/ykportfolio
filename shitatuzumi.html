              <h3> From a chef to a business owner</h3>
              <p>It all began with meeting a client who was also the student of Flutterflow learning Program -
                Progomat. He is a Chinese chef with zero IT background but with passion to build a catering service in
                Japan.

            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <p>While spending most of his time cooking in a Chinese restaurant, he searched and
                discovered a potential career development in the culinary industry - a service that connects chefs and
                users. He began by attending progomat to learn the basics of app development through Flutterflow while
                searching for business partners and collaborators. I was one of the candidates for his business
                proposition but I counter-offered a position of freelance UI/UX designer for him instead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <p>After spending 2 months in coding bootcamp in the beginning of 2024, I always wanted to expand my
                skillsets while working as a freelance designer. This was a perfect project to start with.
                To develop Shitatuzumi we need three major skills:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Find the core value that Shitatuzumi can provide.</li>
                <li>How to implement design prototype from Figma to Flutterflow. </li>
                <li>Knowing how both frontend and backend development works.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Let’s take a look at each of them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <h3> Find the core value that Shitatuzumi can provide</h3>
              <p>The project owner/teammate wants to create this service in Japan. However, there is a big problem - He
                DOESN’T know any Japanese, not to mention the Japanese market. <br>
                Which is why me, as a researcher, participated in the early stage of the app development.
                We started off by asking ourselves who are our target audiences, how do chefs offer their services and
                audiences receive their services.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <p>Target audiences:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Busy salary workers who don't have the time to cook for dinner but want to eat a certain type of
                  food they can’t make or buy.</li>
                <li>Someone who is injured and can’t go outside to buy groceries.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <p>According to a recent study, there are only 10% of the whole Japanese participants (500 people, age range:
                20~59) who never cook at home and 18.6% out of the people who cooks said they cook 1 or 2 times per week.
                We targeted those minorities because it is the easiest and most effective way to make a unique and
                meaningful service. (Higher audience ratio = Higher competition)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <h3>How do chefs offer their services and audiences receive their services</h3>
              <p>From there, we used value proposition canvas to visualize what kind of services can fit to our
                persona’s needs.
                Since our goal is to create an MVP with 2 months, We narrowed our services to 2 features: searching and
                booking.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <h3>How to implement design prototype from Figma to Flutterflow</h3>
              <p>One of our major goals was to complete the first cycle of agile development within 2 months.
                We have discussed whether or not we should make high fidelity prototype on Figma, and because
                Flutterflow is not flexible in design editing, we decided it was still important to use Figma to test
                the user flow. <br>
                We also faced design implementation priority issues. Flutterflow has its own built-in widgets such as
                calendars and input forms. For design convenience, it was preferable to use their provided components.
                However, Flutterflow’s base design language is Material Design 3, which gives limited customizations for
                designers. To tackle this issue, I implemented their built-in widgets into developing MVP, but planning
                to update with datepickers with better customizations that comes close to my original design.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <h3>Knowing how frontend and backend development works</h3>
              <p>As a project manager, I came up with a way to design on Figma while developing on Flutterflow. My way
                was focusing on creating one user flow at a time. With each flow, we ideate key features that we need in
                each page by also considering schema for data management. Pixel perfect was least important, but rather
                adding the right elements to the screen. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <h3>Design brush up</h3>
              <p>To agile devlop Shitatuzumi, I conducted usability testing early on Figama before implementing on Flutterflow, Since we are settled with our main userflow, I tested with 5 people and concluded with few insights: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>users do not use search bar, needed a better search flow by adding more search options and get rid of search bar instead</li>
                  <li>uers were busy scrolling on the homepage without knowing which to choose. We improved the general information hierarchy of the main page.</li>
                  <li>Users had trouble with navigation of the tutorial page so we updated the userflow</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="scroll-paragraph">
              <h3>Reflection</h3>
              <p>My previous experiences in development has definitely influenced my working style - with now focusing
                more on technicality and feasibility rather than just creativity in my design. Due to our time
                limitation in developing, there are lot of features being taken out of consideration. For example, I
                would love to add more service options for chefs, specifically meal prep (A service we came up during
                vale proposition research) because it plays an important role for user to save money. </p>
